# Constraint Satisfaction Problem - Map coloring

I have initially started to solve the problem with python however, faced with maximum recursion depht error and therefore had to switch to java. However, I have still included my python script in the submission for the reference

Most of the program logic has been taken from book and in Java version additionally AC3 has been used in forward checking(usually if AC3 is used as preprocessing, no requirement for forward checking)

# How to run
Simply, run the CSP_map_coloring\CSPJavaSolution\src\Main.java file. After the execution, an input promt will be available to insert file name(full path must be inputed:\n **C:\Users\abagiyev\Project 2\Solution\CSP_map_coloring\CSPJavaSolution\src\input.txt**)
* Run Main.java
* prompt input file full location
